# Implementing web-based discrete choice experiments with Qualtrics, R and Amazon Web Service (AWS)

This repository contains a step by step guide to implement a survey with a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in Qualtrics. It is part of the paper "Implementing web-based discrete choice experiments in transportation" that is currently being reviewed for publication in [Transportation Research Procedia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/transportation-research-procedia?_gl=1*1vrwepw*_ga*NjY1MTg2NDMzLjE2NjM5MjE3MTU.*_ga_4R527DM8F7*MTY2MzkyMTcxNS4xLjAuMTY2MzkyMTcyNi4wLjAuMA..).

The output is a survey like [this](https://ivtethz.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9ykT8FWUU31yjGu) one in Qualtrics.


## Components

1. Simple choice design
2. R Code to display a choice situation in Qualtrics
3. Qualtrics survey template
